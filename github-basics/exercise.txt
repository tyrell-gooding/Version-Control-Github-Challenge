1: the terminal is a way you can access the roots of your computer you can see what files you have downloaded andwhat versions 
of things are downloaded. it's just a way you can talk to your computer without using guis.

2: i think the differents between git and git hub is git is used to control the actions on your computer
and github is used to display those items git pushes to it

3: so there is multiple ways to push items to github you can pull remotely so if you have it locally already 
you can use get remote to push it to git hub or you can create a new repository and commit your file to github 


ex 1: git remote add origin git@github.com:tyrell-gooding/google-homepage.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

ex 2: echo "# google-homepage" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:tyrell-gooding/google-homepage.git
git push -u origin main
